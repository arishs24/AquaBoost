## Installation

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/aqua-boost.git
   cd aqua-boost/backend
Install Python packages:

pip install flask flask-cors serial scikit-learn numpy sqlite3
Set up email credentials:
Update the EMAIL_ADDRESS and EMAIL_PASSWORD in server.py with your email credentials.

Run the backend server:

python server.py
Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory:

cd ../frontend
Install Node.js packages:

npm install
Set up Firebase for user authentication:

Create a Firebase project and add a web app.
Copy your Firebase configuration and update src/firebase.js.
Run the React application:


npm start
Arduino Setup
Connect the hardware components as described in the code comments.
Upload the Arduino code (AquaBoost.ino) to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
Usage
Start the backend server:


python server.py
Start the React application:

npm start
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

Sign up or log in using the authentication form.

Monitor real-time impedance values and predictions on the dashboard.

Configure alert thresholds and receive notifications if values exceed specified limits.
